            <h4>Spam</h4>
            <p>For a change, this canned dish comes from America where it is also known as ‘mystery meat’. It is made of potato starch, water, pork, sugar, sodium nitrate and salt. The name is a clever derivation of ‘SPiced hAM’</p>

            <h4>Bubble & Squeak</h4>
            <p>This food is actually a rubber ducky that squeaks. Kidding again! This dish is (of course) based in the UK and includes fried leftover vegetables. The origin of the name is unclear but its believed to have come from how the veggies squeak and bubble when fried.</p>

            <h4>The Imam Fainted</h4>
            <p>This dish is also known as ‘the priest fainted’. Just the name will never clear the contents of the dish, which is an Ottoman delicacy made of whole eggplants, garlic and tomatoes. </p>
